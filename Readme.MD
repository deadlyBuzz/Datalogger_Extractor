This is a program to iterate through an Allen Bradley L5K program and extract the data held in a specific datalogger object type.
This data will then be stored in an SQLLite DB for extraction using Excel, Node.JS, LibreOffice etc.
Plan to be the basis of some further operations extracting file data

Initial plan to use JavaFX and FXML for the operation of Scenebuilder and rich interfaces
Built on Oracle Java JDK8 until an equally prevalent distribution is rolled out to different workstations.
